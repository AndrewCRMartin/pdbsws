Look at BruteForceScan.log to see chains that no longer exist
e.g.
INFO: Updating 12as chain 'X'
Error: No memory for sequence data
ERROR: Failed to write sequence file for 12as chain 'X'

--or--

INFO: Processing 3f9k chain 'd' : Error: No memory for sequence data
ERROR: Failed to write sequence file for 3f9k chain 'd'

This is because chain names have changed


Errors such as:
INFO: Processing 3chx chain 'N' : ERROR: Failed to write sequence file for 3chx chain 'N'
are genuine cases where the sequence is non-standard and full of Xs
