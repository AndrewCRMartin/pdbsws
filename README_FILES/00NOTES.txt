1pdgB and 1pdgC fail in BruteForceScan because there is a stretch
of 11 residues missing from the coordinates (and from the sequence
used for the scan). Therefore the percentage ID over that matched
range falls to 88.298%, although it is 100% over the aligned
residues. Currently, the code picks up the percent ID from the
FASTA printed info - perhaps we should change this so it works
it out itself over aligned residues. Would need a change to
BruteForceScan.pl/BruteFASTA()

What happens with 1pdgA? We don't seem to be getting the whole
sequence aligned.
